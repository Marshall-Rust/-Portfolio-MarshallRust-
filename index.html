          "Your presence does not surprise me, Assassin.
           I have known of you ever since your craft entered the Eastern Fringes.
           Why did I not have you killed? Because your mission and the act you are about to commit proves the truth of all I have ever said or done.
           I merely punished those who had wronged, just as your false Emperor now seeks to punish me. Death is nothing compared to vindication."
