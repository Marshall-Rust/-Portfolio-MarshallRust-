Homework #2 creating a portfolio

I had a hard time with this project.
I couldn't get the border set up to the right of about me/work.
I also ran into the issues of getting text on my photos and getting the 4 smaller photos to flex wrap  into a 2x2 stack. just all around struggled with this project. I think i wrote out my code poorly and working on it through the week i think i lost tracked on what i was doing. I didnt add enough notes to get myself back on track. Also just kinda ran outta time. I need to do better on my next project.
